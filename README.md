# Backblaze B2 Event Broker

The Backblaze B2 Event Broker is a [Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) that forwards Backblaze B2 Event Notifications to subscribers. The event broker implements a simple RESTful API for clients to create, query and delete subscriptions.

The event broker is intended for use with [B2listen](https://github.com/backblaze-b2-samples/b2listen/), but may be useful in other situations.

## Event Notifications

The event broker is designed to receive event notification messages from Backblaze B2 and forward them to subscribers. All incoming HTTP POST requests that do not include the subscriptions path prefix, `/@subscriptions`, are treated as event notifications.

The event broker validates that incoming event notifications are signed with the shared secret, then responds to Backblaze B2 with a 200 HTTP status code and empty payload before forwarding the event notification(s) to subscribers.

## Prerequisites

* A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers).
* [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started).
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16.17.0 or later.
* [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).

## Deployment

Clone this repository to your machine and `cd` into the repository directory:

```console
% git clone git@github.com:backblaze-b2-samples/b2-event-broker.git
Cloning into 'b2-event-broker'...
...
% cd b2-event-broker
```

Install dependencies:

```console
% npm install
...
added 82 packages, and audited 83 packages in 3s
...
```

Edit the worker name in `wrangler.toml` if you wish.

Deploy the worker to your Cloudflare account:

```console
% npx wrangler deploy

 ‚õÖÔ∏è wrangler 3.73.0

Current Version ID: 01f24f1b-9e03-466e-aebb-530636b9748f
```

Configure a Cloudflare Secret named `SIGNING_SECRET` with the shared secret from your event notification rule(s). Wrangler will prompt you to enter the value:

```console
% npx wrangler secret put SIGNING_SECRET

 ‚õÖÔ∏è wrangler 3.73.0 (update available 3.74.0)
-------------------------------------------------------

‚úî Enter a secret value: ‚Ä¶ ********************************
üåÄ Creating the secret for the Worker "event-broker-test"
‚ú® Success! Uploaded secret SIGNING_SECRET
```

The `wrangler.toml` file includes a variable, `MAX_FAILURE_COUNT`, set to 5 by default, that controls the number of delivery attempts that the event broker will make for an event notification before automatically removing a subscription. The first retry is immediate, the second after 1 second, the third after 2 seconds, the fourth after 4 seconds, and so on.

## Subscriptions

Subscriptions are resources with URL paths of the form `/@subscriptions/{bucket-name}/{rule-name}/{id}` and content of the form:

```json
{
    "url": "https://example.com/listener"
}
```

ALL incoming requests, both subscription requests and event notifications, must be signed using a shared secret. The shared secret is the same as the shared secret in your event notification rule(s), and is configured as a [Cloudflare Secret](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/) so that the event broker can validate the signature.

### Create a Subscription

POST a JSON-formatted body containing the subscriber URL to a URL of the form `/@subscriptions/{bucket-name}/{rule-name}`. The event broker will respond with a JSON-formatted message containing the subscription ID. For example:

```console
% curl https://event-broker.acme.workers.dev/@subscriptions/my-bucket/my-rule \
    -d '{ "url" : "https://example.com/listener" }' \
    -H 'x-bz-event-notification-signature: v1=355caf3f1a5e92ba2bea08394f0d68d3952c79d1055574f540faef1dcaea77b5'
{"id":"ce986d9c-86f3-4fb4-99d6-366acbb133c9"}
```

### Get Subscription Details

GET the subscription's URL to receive JSON-formatted subscription details:

```console
% curl https://event-broker.acme.workers.dev/@subscriptions/metadaddy-tester/allEvents/ce986d9c-86f3-4fb4-99d6-366acbb133c9 -H 'x-bz-event-notification-signature: v1=329b6adc5eb23b4221ada77fe19751e30a92ba17c5518cb0d44ed00b5dbdb08c'
{"url":"https://example.com/listener"}
```

### Delete a Subscription

Send a DELETE request to the subscription's URL. The event broker responds with the subscription details.

```console
% curl https://event-broker.acme.workers.dev/@subscriptions/metadaddy-tester/allEvents/ce986d9c-86f3-4fb4-99d6-366acbb133c9 -H 'x-bz-event-notification-signature: v1=329b6adc5eb23b4221ada77fe19751e30a92ba17c5518cb0d44ed00b5dbdb08c' -X DELETE
{"url":"https://example.com/listener"}
```
